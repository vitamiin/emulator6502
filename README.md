Following the tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc

This project isn't really mine and definitely not my idea, im following code from the tutorial above and understanding it along the way
in order to understand a basic CPU and the process of emulating it, so I may build projects like these from scratch myself in the near future. This is also good for acquiring a better understanding of the modern computer stack.
